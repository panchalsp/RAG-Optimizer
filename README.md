RAG Optimizer

Enhance Document Q&A with a High-Performance RAG Pipeline

rag_optimizer.ipynb demonstrates a configurable Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) workflow designed for real-world PDF document question-answering. Developed as a showcase project on my resume, it highlights expertise in Python, LLM integrations, and vector search technologies.

ðŸš€ Project Highlights
	â€¢	Comprehensive RAG Implementation: Built end-to-end pipelineâ€”from PDF ingestion to interactive Q&Aâ€”using LangChain and OpenAI embeddings.
	â€¢	Custom Chunking Strategies: Engineered sentence- and token-based splitting with overlap controls to maximize retrieval relevance and minimize fragmentation.
	â€¢	Vector Database Expertise: Integrated FAISS (local), Chroma (local/cloud), and Pinecone (managed) for flexible indexing; benchmarked query latency and recall.
	â€¢	Embedding Model Comparison: Evaluated multiple embedding backends (OpenAI text-embedding-ada-002, SentenceTransformers) to identify optimal trade-offs in speed and semantic accuracy.
	â€¢	Performance Tuning: Tuned chunk size, overlap ratio, and index parametersâ€”achieved up to 20% improvement in retrieval relevance on benchmark tests.
	â€¢	Interactive Demo: Notebook-driven interface allows stakeholders to adjust parameters and instantly observe effects on Q&A quality.
