RAG Optimizer

Enhance Document Q&A with a High-Performance RAG Pipeline

rag_optimizer.ipynb demonstrates a configurable Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) workflow designed for real-world PDF document question-answering. Developed as a showcase project on my resume, it highlights expertise in Python, LLM integrations, and vector search technologies.

ðŸš€ Project Highlights

â€¢	End-to-End RAG Pipeline: Orchestrated PDF ingestion via PDFMinerLoader, semantic chunking with LangChainâ€™s SemanticChunker, and RetrievalQA using OpenAI and HuggingFace embeddings.

â€¢	Custom Chunking Strategies: Tuned min_chunk_size, overlap, and splitting methods (sentence-based, token-based) to optimize chunk relevance and context preservation.

â€¢	Embedding Model Evaluation: Compared OpenAI text-embedding-3-small against HuggingFaceâ€™s all-mpnet-base-v2, analyzing trade-offs in latency and semantic retrieval quality.

â€¢	Vector Database Benchmarking: Indexed embeddings in FAISS (local), Chroma, and Qdrant; measured query latencies and result counts across stores to identify optimal performance.

â€¢	Performance Analysis: Logged retrieval latencies with time.perf_counter(), visualized results in a pandas DataFrame to guide index parameter tuning.

â€¢	Interactive Notebook Demo: Provides parameterized cells for loaders, chunkers, and vector stores, enabling real-time experimentation and rapid iteration.
